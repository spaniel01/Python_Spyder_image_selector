# Description
Small program to make the task of selecting photos, involving a lot of clicking if done manually, easier. 

Must be opened in **Spyder** to work.

Basic features:
- Prompts for setting photo location (working directory, wd)
- Selects only image files from wd
- Displays image in Spyder via matplotlib
- Prompts user to decide whether to keep or discard an image. User may also view the last previously kept or discarded image
- Finally, provided no such folder exists, creates new folder called "keep" and copies images that user wishes to keep into that folder. If that folder already exists, only moves images into it
